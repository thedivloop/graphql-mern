### Problems

In the MONGO_URI the special characters in the password have to be URL encoded, [check this out](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/troubleshoot-connection/#special-characters-in-connection-string-password).


### Git - Github

https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq/git-rename-master-to-main

Rename local branch
```
git branch -m master main
```

Add origin URL
```
git remote add origin URL
```
Initial push 
```
git push --set-upstream origin main
```

Force your local repo to github if any problem (this will overwrite your github repo content!!)
```bash
git push origin main --force
```
